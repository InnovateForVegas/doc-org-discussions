        time, effort, and expertise to bear on various initiatives and endeavors aimed at continuing the Purpose of the Foundation,
        *To Enable and Encourage Ideation, Innovation, and Implementation to Make our Communities Better.*

        ## My Interest Areas
        
        Most Initiatives and Projects are made up of several components, only some of which are *code*. If you are a coder (javascript,
        python, rust, sql, etc), that is great, but not required at all. We do use GitHub for initiative and component project management,
        so a willingness to interact with GitHub (as you are doing now) is a bare minimum… 

        **Note**: Our Whole Team approach means *Management* roles and responsibilities are shared, but it is always helpful to have at
        least one person keeping track of the details.

        The *Innovate for Vegas Foundation* is all volunteer, so it may take a moment to respond, and then there may
        be some discussion, here in this discussion forum and/or via email, or if you would like to join in our
        typically-weekly office hours online, etc.

        Stay tuned, and thanks for your interest!

        To be continued…
